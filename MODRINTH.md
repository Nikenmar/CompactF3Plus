# Compact F3 Plus

A sleek, minimal, and highly customizable HUD overlay for Forge 1.19.2. It replaces the dense, cluttered vanilla F3 debug screen with a clean interface showing only essential information.

This branch is a maintained backport of the original NeoForge 1.21.1 project.

This mod works client-side only. No server installation is required or supported. Players can configure individual HUD elements through the native in-game Mod Menu.

### Information

The mod supports two operating modes:

- **Replace F3 Mode (Default):** Pressing `F3` opens the compact HUD instead of the vanilla debug screen.
- **Standalone Mode:** Disable the replacement in the config and toggle the HUD anytime using `F8` (configurable in the Controls menu).

Features:

* shows FPS (including average) with dynamic color indicators
* designed for compatibility with most UI mods
* fully configurable via in-game settings
