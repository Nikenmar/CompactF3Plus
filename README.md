**Compact F3 Plus** is a client-side NeoForge mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 that replaces the dense, cluttered vanilla F3 debug screen with a clean and minimal HUD overlay. It displays only the essential information you need, anchored to the top left of your screen on a sleek transparent background.

*(This is an actively maintained fork of the original "Compact F3" by username65735).*
